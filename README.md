# Almond

Almond is a simple application framework built with Dear ImGui and designed to be used with SDL Renderer - basically this means you can seemlessly blend real-time platform agnostic rendering with a great UI library to build desktop applications.

Currently non-functional  
You will have to contribute Windows and Mac support yourself!
